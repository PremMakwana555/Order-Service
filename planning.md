Build a Spring Boot Order Service MVP with Saga orchestration, Outbox pattern, and Kafka simulation using GitHub Student Pack tools. Step 1: Redeem Copilot, Codespaces, DigitalOcean, Heroku, MongoDB, and JetBrains from https://education.github.com/pack
. Step 2: Create GitHub repo your-org/order-service-mvp, enable Issues + Actions, open in Codespaces with Java image or Spring template, enable Copilot inline completions. Step 3: Generate a Spring Boot 3.1 project using Maven with dependencies spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa, spring-kafka, mysql-connector-java, resilience4j, spring-boot-starter-actuator, lombok, flyway, spring-boot-starter-test, with packages api, service, domain, kafka, outbox, config. Create entities Order, OrderLine, OutboxEvent, and OrderSaga using @Version and timestamps, add Flyway migration V1__create_orders_outbox.sql, implement OrderRepository and OrderService.createOrder() that starts a transaction, saves Order (CREATED/PENDING_PAYMENT), writes OutboxEvent(eventType=OrderCreated), and commits. Add Docker Compose (docker-compose.kafka.yml) for Kafka + Zookeeper or create an in-memory Kafka simulator. Implement OutboxPublisher scheduled component polling outbox_event, publishing to Kafka topic orders.events, marking published. Verify with curl POST /api/v1/orders and Kafka consumer logs. Add Saga store with OrderSaga entity and SagaService tracking states STARTED, WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT, COMPLETED, COMPENSATING, COMPENSATED. Modify createOrder() to create Saga row and publish PaymentRequested to payments.commands. Add Kafka consumer PaymentEventsConsumer for payments.events to handle PaymentSucceeded and PaymentFailed; on success update order to CONFIRMED and write OrderConfirmed outbox, on failure update order to CANCELLED and optionally publish ReleaseInventory. Simulate Payment Service with /simulate/payment endpoint or background job emitting success/fail to payments.events. Add middleware for Idempotency-Key using Redis or DB table idempotency_keys. Test happy (PaymentSucceeded) and failure (PaymentFailed) paths and verify saga logs show sagaId correlation. Add GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to run mvn -B test with Maven cache and docker/setup-buildx-action. Use Testcontainers for integration tests with MySQL + Kafka asserting Order.status == CONFIRMED. Add resilience4j retry around Kafka send, log correlationId + sagaId, optionally add OpenTelemetry traces. Update README with setup, docker-compose, endpoints, and payment simulation instructions. Deploy demo using Heroku (heroku login, heroku create order-service-demo, Procfile: web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT -jar target/.jar, git push heroku main) or DigitalOcean ($200 credit, connect repo, mvn package, java -jar target/.jar, optional Droplet for Kafka). Prefer Heroku for fast demo, DigitalOcean for flexibility. Student Pack usage: Copilot Pro for code generation, Codespaces for dev env, DigitalOcean for cloud deploy, Heroku for demo deploy, MongoDB Atlas optional, JetBrains IDE optional. Final goal: CI-tested, deployable Order Service MVP showing Saga + Outbox pattern with Kafka events, resilient orchestration, and interview-ready demonstration.
